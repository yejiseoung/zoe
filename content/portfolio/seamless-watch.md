Spending a lot of money on creating a movie does not gaurantee that they can get a lot of revenue from the movie. Even though it costed 220 million USD to create The Avengers, they made 150 million USD. The cost for making Rocky was 1 million USD, but they brought in 117.2 million USD. Then, how can we predict the movie revenue?

In this project, I built a machine learning model to predict movie revenue by analyzing [TMDB Box Office dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tmdb-box-office-prediction/data). `I used lightGBM to build the model and got 1.96 RMSLE score.`
