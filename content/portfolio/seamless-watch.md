Spending a lot of resources on creating a movie does not gaurantee a lot of revenue generated from the movie release. Even though it costed 200 million dollars to create "Mulan", it only made 70 million dollars. The cost for making "Rocky" was 1 million dollars, but box office proceeds were in 117.2 million dollars. Then, how can we predict movie revenue?

In this project, I built a machine learning model to predict movie revenue by analyzing [TMDB Box Office dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tmdb-box-office-prediction/data). `I used lightGBM to build the model and got a 1.96 RMSLE score.`
