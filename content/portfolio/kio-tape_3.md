I explored `Telco Cusomter Churn` dataset containing 7043 customers’ demographic information, customer's account information, and services that customers have signed up. 


I found that customers who were using fiber optic for Internet service tend to end the service compared to those using DSL. I cannot conclude that Fiber optic for Internet Service might have poor service compared to DSL from this dataset, but in the further research, if I can get more information on like service satisfaction, Internet service quality, the price of those services, then I can find more why customers churned. 

I also found that churned customers tended to be charged monthly more compared to retaining customers, and high monthly payment can be an effect on customers’ decision on retaining or not. 

Churned customers are distributed on relatively new contract on the service compared to retained customers. Since they have less loyalty to the service, they easily decided to quit the service. 

Interestingly, when customers contract on month-to-month, they are more likely to churn compared to those contract on year-contract.
