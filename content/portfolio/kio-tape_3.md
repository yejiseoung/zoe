I explored `Telco Cusomter Churn` dataset containing 7043 customers’ demographic information, customer's account information, and services that customers have signed up for. 


I found that customers who were using fiber optic for Internet service tended to end their service compared to those using DSL. I could not conclude that Fiber optic for Internet Service may have had poorer service compared to DSL from this dataset, but if I can get more information on like service satisfaction, Internet service quality, and the price of those services, then I can find more why customers churned. 

I also found that churned customers tended to be charged more monthly compared to retaining customers, and a high monthly payment can affect customers’ decision on retaining services. 

Churned customers are distributed on relatively new contracts compared to retained customers. As they have less customers for a shorter period, they have less loyalty to the service, and more likely to quit the service. 

Put in another way and in conclusion, when customers are contracted on month-to-month basis, they are more likely to churn compared to those contract on yearly-contract.
