The project goal was to investigate No-Show-Medical-Appointments data. 

It would be very inefficient if there are many patients would not show up on their scheduled time. Therefore, it would be nice to investigate whether there is any differences between people show up on scheduled time and those do not. 

I explored the dataset which contains 100,527 medical appointments with 14 variables (features) by creating several visualizations. 

Based on the visualizations, I found that SMS reminders to no-show patients would help them keep scheduled time. Also, 10's and 20's are more likely to not show up on schedule time.
