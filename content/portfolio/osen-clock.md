The purpose of this project is to build `a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model to classify disaster messages`. The web app helps categorize the disaster messages into 36 categories. The web app provides emergency workers to input a new message and get classification results. The web app also displays visualizations of the data. 

This project is the part of Data Science Nanodegree Program by Udacity by using disaster messages provided by Figure Eight. The dataset contains labeled tweet and messages from real-life disaster events. 

I built ETL pipeline to clean, engineer features and analyze data. Also, ML pipeline helps automate building machine learning model, and classify disaster messages.
